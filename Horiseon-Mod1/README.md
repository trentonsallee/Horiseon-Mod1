# Horiseon-Mod1

This project can be described as cleaning the code.
Alot of repetive codes were replaced or commited out to create a more simplistic code.
Non-semantic code was replaced with semantic code to add clarrification.
Alt comments were placed in all immages on the website, along with the title background.
The code is structuered in a logical order.

Below is the User's story and Acceptence Critera used as refrence for this Challenge.

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
